# AWS EC2 Inference Solution - Development Roadmap

## Project Status Summary

The AWS EC2 Inference Solution is currently in a functional MVP state. The solution provides a fully automated deployment of a containerized inference application on AWS EC2 using Terraform. Below is a detailed breakdown of completed work and planned future enhancements.

## Completed Work

### Core Infrastructure

- [x] VPC with public and private subnets
- [x] EC2 instance with latest Ubuntu AMI
- [x] Security groups for controlled access
- [x] IAM roles with least privilege
- [x] ECR repository for Docker images
- [x] Route53 DNS configuration
- [x] Idempotent infrastructure design
- [x] Controlled deployment mechanism with versioning

### Application Components

- [x] Sample Node.js API application
- [x] Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Build and push automation
- [x] Systemd service for container management
- [x] Automatic image update mechanism

### Terraform Organization

- [x] Modular structure for maintainability
- [x] S3 backend for state management
- [x] Output values for easy access to resources
- [x] Variable definitions for customization
- [x] README with comprehensive documentation

## Current Sprint (Milestone 2)

### High Availability & Scaling

- [ ] Convert EC2 to Auto Scaling Group
- [ ] Add Application Load Balancer
- [ ] Configure health checks and scaling policies
- [ ] Update Route53 to point to load balancer

### Enhanced Security

- [x] Add HTTPS support with ACM certificates
- [x] Implement proper security headers
- [ ] Add WAF rules for API protection
- [ ] Implement more granular IAM permissions

### Monitoring & Logging

- [ ] Set up CloudWatch dashboards
- [ ] Configure alarms for key metrics
- [ ] Implement structured logging
- [ ] Create operational runbooks

## Future Development (Milestone 3)

### Advanced Features

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline integration
- [x] Basic controlled deployment with version-based replacement (foundation for Blue/Green)
- [ ] Full Blue/Green deployment with traffic switching
- [x] Custom domain management
- [x] SSL management with Let's Encrypt
- [ ] Secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

### Performance Optimization

- [ ] Configure instance profiles for workload
- [ ] Implement API caching mechanism
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Optimize Docker image size

### Cost Optimization

- [ ] Implement cost allocation tags
- [ ] Schedule scaling for predictable workloads
- [ ] Analyze and optimize resource usage
- [ ] Create budget alerts

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow

1. Feature branches should be created from `develop`
2. Use descriptive branch names: `feature/feature-name`, `bugfix/issue-description`
3. Pull requests require at least one review before merging
4. Squash commits when merging to keep history clean

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: For application code
2. **Integration Tests**: For API endpoints
3. **Infrastructure Tests**: Using Terratest
4. **End-to-End Tests**: Validating full deployment

### Release Process

1. Create release branch from `develop`: `release/vX.Y.Z`
2. Complete testing and bug fixes
3. Merge to `main` with version tag
4. Update documentation with release notes
5. Merge release branch back to `develop`

## Required Resources

### Team Composition

- 1 DevOps Engineer (infrastructure, CI/CD)
- 1 Backend Developer (API, application logic)
- 1 QA Engineer (testing, validation)

### Tools & Services

- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform Cloud (optional for remote state)
- Docker Hub or similar for base images
- CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
- Monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Datadog, etc.)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk                     | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation                         |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| AWS service limits       | High   | Medium     | Request limit increases in advance |
| Security vulnerabilities | High   | Medium     | Regular security scans, updates    |
| Cost overruns            | Medium | Low        | Set up budgets, alerts             |
| Deployment failures      | Medium | Low        | Automated testing, rollback plan   |
| Performance issues       | Medium | Medium     | Load testing, scaling policies     |

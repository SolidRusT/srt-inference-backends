# AWS EC2 Inference Solution - Project Summary

## Project Overview

The AWS EC2 Inference Solution is a comprehensive, Terraform-based infrastructure as code solution for deploying containerized inference applications on AWS. It was developed to provide a reliable, repeatable, and maintainable approach to deploying AI inference services, with specific optimizations for large language models (LLMs).

## Key Features

- **Fully Automated Deployment**: Complete infrastructure provisioning with a single `terraform apply` command
- **S3-Based Deployment Architecture**: Modular, maintainable script organization with S3 integration
- **Docker-Based Architecture**: Containerized application deployment for consistency and portability
- **GPU Acceleration Support**: Optional GPU-accelerated inference with NVIDIA driver integration
- **Intelligent Timeout Management**: Multi-layered timeout handling for large model inference
- **LLM Optimization**: Specifically designed for running large language models with vLLM
- **OpenAI-Compatible API**: Implements compatible API endpoints for easy integration
- **HTTPS Security**: Let's Encrypt integration for secure HTTPS connections
- **Robust Service Management**: Multi-layered service monitoring and recovery
- **DNS Integration**: Automatic Route53 record creation for user-friendly access
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation for architecture, operations, customization, and development

## Development History

The project was initiated in March 2025 as a solution for deploying inference services in a more automated and maintainable way than existing approaches. Key development milestones include:

1. **Initial Architecture Design**: Created a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
2. **Core Infrastructure Modules**: Developed VPC, EC2, ECR, and Route53 modules
3. **Application Integration**: Created a Node.js API proxy and vLLM integration
4. **Build Pipeline**: Implemented automatic Docker image building and ECR deployment
5. **GPU Acceleration**: Added support for NVIDIA GPU instances for faster inference
6. **S3-Based Deployment**: Refactored to use S3 for more maintainable deployment scripts
7. **Intelligent Timeout Handling**: Implemented multi-layered timeout management for large models
8. **Robust Service Management**: Enhanced service startup, monitoring, and recovery mechanisms
9. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the solution

## Current Status

The solution is currently in a production-ready state with all core features implemented. It provides a robust platform for deploying language model inference applications, with specific optimizations for large models like those in the 32B parameter range.

## Project Structure

The solution follows a modular structure:

- **Core Terraform Configuration**: Main configuration files in the root directory
- **Terraform Modules**: Modular components in the `modules/` directory:
  - `vpc`: Network infrastructure
  - `ec2`: Compute resources with templates for deployment scripts
  - `ecr`: Container registry
  - `route53`: DNS configuration
  - `build`: Image build/push logic
  - `scripts_bucket`: S3 deployment script management
- **Application Code**: API proxy application in the `app/` directory
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation in the `docs/` directory

## Technical Architecture

The solution implements several advanced architectural patterns:

1. **S3-Based Deployment Architecture**:
   - Templates rendered and uploaded to S3 during Terraform apply
   - Minimal bootstrap script in EC2 user_data
   - Modular script organization for better maintainability

2. **Multi-Layer Service Management**:
   - Systemd service definitions
   - Boot-time service verification
   - Post-reboot service recovery
   - Docker container lifecycle management

3. **Intelligent Timeout Handling**:
   - Application-layer dynamic timeouts based on request attributes
   - NGINX pattern-based timeout configuration
   - Configurable timeout thresholds via Terraform variables

4. **GPU Acceleration**:
   - NVIDIA driver installation
   - Docker NVIDIA runtime integration
   - vLLM tensor parallelism for multi-GPU setups

## Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, ECR, VPC, Route53, S3)
- **IaC**: Terraform 1.7+
- **Container Technology**: Docker with NVIDIA runtime support
- **Proxy Application**: Node.js/Express
- **Inference Engine**: vLLM (Vector LLM)
- **Web Server**: NGINX
- **TLS Certificates**: Let's Encrypt
- **Version Control**: Git

## Future Development

Future development plans are detailed in the [Development Roadmap](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md), with key focus areas including:

1. **High Availability**: Moving from single instance to auto-scaling group and load balancer
2. **Enhanced Security**: Adding WAF and more granular IAM permissions
3. **Monitoring and Alerting**: Implementing comprehensive CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Enhancing the build and deployment pipeline
5. **Model Management**: Adding model versioning and A/B testing capabilities
6. **Cost Optimization**: Implementing instance scheduling and right-sizing
